# WebApp-OnlineStore-a2

The website application is built using a combination of PHP, javascript, Ajax and Session to store and retrieve data from a database.
These technologies enable the website to store and track user activity, such as items in a shopping cart.
Furthermore, by using Ajax it is possible for the website to update information on the client side without needing to reload the page, providing a more responsive and streamlined user experience.
